# In python there is a super easy way to show things on the screen or terminal
# You can use the 'Print' function 
print ("Hello World")

# Unlike C and other program languages, we don't need to worry about line management
print ("Because this is on a different line")

# If you however wanted to print things on the same line you can do that too
print ("I want this on a line", end='')
print ("I also want this on the same line")

# Watch out for not spacing it correctly though like above
print ("Look same line and a space", end=' ')
print ("so cool!")

# You can also add lines using \n as a character
print("Notice\nHow\nEach\nWord\nIs\nOn\A\nDifferent\nLine")
